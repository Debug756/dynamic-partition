For people who want to boot OnePlus 7T/7T Pro Image here is the guide:

We can use Erfan Tool but before that we need a modified system.img, since OnePlus 7T/7T Pro have dynamic partition.
-Download and extract the payload.bin in the oneplus 7T/7T Pro ota using payload dumper.
-Take out system.img, product.img and opproduct.img and place them in separate folder.


Steps For making that system partition:

1. Open terminal and type sudo su

2. Then this for making a 4gb empty system_new.img
  dd if=/dev/zero of=system_new.img bs=4k count=1048576
   
3. Formating the system_new.img with EXT4
  mkfs.ext4 system_new.img   

4. We override the file system check (If you don`t do this, the image will not work)
  tune2fs -c0 -i0 system_new.img
   
5. Mount this system_new.img and the system.img from the ota package as mentioned above
  mkdir system
  mkdir system_new
  
  mount -o loop system_new.img system_new/
  mount -o ro system.img system/
  
6. We copy the content from the old system.img in the system_new.img and sync them
  cp -v -r -p system/* system_new/
  sync
  
   Then,
  umount system/
  
7. Open terminal in the mounted system_new.img and type
  sudo rmdir product

8. Now add a link file in system_new.img with link to system/product (i copied it from OnePlus 7 system.img which i mount separatly)
  mkdir systemop7
  mount -o loop system.img systemop7/
  cp -v -r -p systemop7/product /system_new
  umount systemop7/
  
   This will add the link file in system_new.img and then we will make the product directory in system_new/system which the link file is directing to.
   Open terminal in system_new/system and type
  sudo rm product
  sudo mkdir product

9. Now we have to mount the 7T product.img and copy its data to system_new.img and sync them
  mkdir product
  mount -o ro product.img product/
  cp -v -r -p product/* /system_new/system/product
  sync
  umount product/

10. Now we have to mount the 7T opproduct.img and copy its data to system_new.img and sync them
   mkdir opproduct
   mount -o ro opproduct.img opproduct/
   cp -v -r -p opproduct/* /system_new/oneplus
   sync
   umount opproduct/
   umount system_new/
   
11. Now take the system_new.img and rename it to system.img and zip to op7t.zip
12. Run erfans tool on this zip now u will get your gsi
   sudo ./url2gsi op7t.zip OxygenOS --ab
